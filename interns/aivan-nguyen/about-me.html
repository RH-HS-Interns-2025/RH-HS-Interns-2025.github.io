        <p>A picture of me out front of the Red Hat building! It was my first day at Red Hat for the High School Internship Program. I didn't really know what to expect but I had an amazing first day. I was amazed at how relaxed the environment was and the free snacks that were available!</p>

        <h3>Dungeons & Dragons Session!</h3>
        <p>I'm a huge Dungeons & Dragons fan. The roleplaying, the worldbuilding, just the whole vibe makes it super appealing! This was a photo from one of the sessions after school. In this session, we were sent off on a quest to defeat a rat that has been prowling the sewers. And even after all the obstacles we faced, we defeated the rat!</p>

        <h3>King's Dominion</h3>
        <p>On April 26th, 2025, I went to King's Dominion with the Franklinton High School's Choral Program to compete in the Music in the Parks competition. While being able to go to King's Dominion was a huge incentive for a lot of us, we still put in the effort to learn and polish the music we planned on singing for the judges. </p>
        <p> And our hardwork paid off! We were able to score 2nd place in our category and brought back a trophy! I enjoyed riding roller coasters with my friends and peers, making memories I won't ever forget.</p>

        <h3>Duke Math Meet</h3>
        <p>During my sophomore year of high school, I was given the opportunity to compete at Duke University's Math Meet. Our school's team didn't expect to win anything, we just wanted to have fun and eat a good lunch. As long as we got 1 point, we'd be satisifed. It was an enjoyable experience to go with my friends as well as take memorable pictures like this one. Though, I would have to critique that the food wasn't that good and they ran out of it quickly. </p>

        <h3>Hobby or Addiction?</h3>
        <p>Sometimes, I don't know what the line between a hobby or an addiction is. Which... sounds really bad. As an avid reader, I really love reading books and as such, I buy a lot of them and sometimes when I buy them, I don't even read them. All the time, people would tell me to just borrow books but that doesn't really seem ideal to me. I do eventually get to reading the books I buy but seeing how big my to be read list is, I might be set until 2026!</p>

        <h3>My Pride and Joy</h3>
        <p>Everyone has that one thing/project that becomes their one pride and joy. This is mine.</p>
        <p>This picture doesn't really tell much about it but to clear up on some confusion, it's a wiki that I edit and manage myself! This wiki hosts all the worldbuilding and lore I create for my stories; it allows me to organize everything into pages and sub-pages.</p>
        <p>My wiki is hosted on miraheze which uses the same software that Wikipedia uses, MediaWiki!</p>
